Hey, check whether parent nvoelty is recomputed each time or not (especially with learnt nov)

ATTENTION!!!!!

note that batchnorm doesn't make sense for the frozen encoder as its result MUST be frozen. Batchnorm will change them depending on the batch

ATTENTION!!!!!

The analysis tools have been tailored to 2d behaviors (the batch given is 600x2, where the second dim is the dimension of descriptors and 600 the number of vertical samples)

==> remedy that!






Note: doesn't sound like a good idea to have cavefly as an env here, as the main issue with that env is state representation, not novelty search
      Also, it would make sense to show that learned behaviors descriptors are interesting where there is some information that isn't just captured
      by the trajectory. In the case of exploratory cavefly, that doens't hold as it is just like the maze.

      other candidates are 
                   - collectball (this is a good example as it requires not only trajectory but different exploratory vs direct behaviors)
                           is there a way to interpret learned BDs as "exploratory" etc?
                   - kuka

Note: dist_thresh is now unused in the novelty_estimator hierarchy, it should be removed

NOTE: the decoder produces rectangular artifacts due to deconvolution, I haven't found any good solution to that so I've left it as it is, since it's good enough for our experiments

- run experiments with other bds
- run experiments regarding archive-less novelty with two encoders
- run experiments comparing behavior trees with FC controllers
- Cleanup by separating abstract classes in their own files
- move parsing config to somewhere else
- Add contributors to headers etc
- Make sure that you can use gpl when some of the dependencies (e.g. procgen) are under Apache2 (and if using mujoco, it's even worse)
- make sure problems are imported in ns.py only based on configuration (why import some weird stuff when you need hardmaze only)
- yapf it all up
- transfer from bitbucket to github
- (optional) Add an ipyparallel version

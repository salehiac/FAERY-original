Note: doesn't sound like a good idea to have cavefly as an env here, as the main issue with that env is state representation, not novelty search
      Also, it would make sense to show that learned behaviors descriptors are interesting where there is some information that isn't just captured
      by the trajectory. In the case of exploratory cavefly, that doens't hold as it is just like the maze.

      other candidates are 
                   - collectball (this is a good example as it requires not only trajectory but different exploratory vs direct behaviors)
                           is there a way to interpret learned BDs as "exploratory" etc?

- First things first, finish implementing everything and test everything with hardmaze before doing anything else

- Add resume from given generation               => not necessary yet, we'll do that once something gets cut in the middle :). Some stub is in place though

- run experiments with default behavior descriptors (hardmaze first)
- run experiments with other bds
- run experiments regarding archive-less novelty with two encoders
- run experiments comparing behavior trees with FC controllers
- Cleanup by separating abstract classes in their own files
- move parsing config to somewhere else
- Add contributors to headers etc
- Make sure that you can use gpl when some of the dependencies (e.g. procgen) are under Apache2 (and if using mujoco, it's even worse)
- make sure problems are imported in ns.py only based on configuration (why import some weird stuff when you need hardmaze only)
- yapf it all up
- transfer from bitbucket to github
- (optional) Add an ipyparallel version
